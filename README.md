Implementations of various compression algorithms for fun.

## [Huffman Coding - NodeJS](./huffman-node/README)
For my first algorithm, I used NodeJS to implement [Huffman Coding](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)
Huffman Coding is mathematically the most efficient way of compressing single character tokens. Using NodeJS was a mistake, and I think I might use C# for future stuff. For more, see the [readme](./huffman-node/README)
